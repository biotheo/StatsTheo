A frequency distribution is the pattern of frequencies of a variable. It’s the number of times each possible value of a variable occurs in a dataset. Example: in a given dataset that record the height of 50 children, we can group the data in 6 height categories. Now, we can build a frequency distribution table, adding the Absolute Frequency (i.e. the number of children within each category) and the Relative Frequency (i.e. the percentage over the total). We will obtain… Height (cm) of children Absolute frequency Relative frequency 120 – 130 9 18% 130 – 140 10 20% 140 – 150 13 26% 150 – 160 11 22% 160 – 170 7 14% Total 50 100% 3.1.1 Graphical representation of frequency distribution It is important to graphically represent the data and group of data. In this case, frequency distribution can be presented in graphical form as: histograms, bar plot (or bar chart) and pie plot. Histograms A histogram is a type of graph in which each column represents a numeric variable, in particular that which is continuous and/or grouped. Other features: The height of the column shows the frequency for a specific range of values. Columns are usually of equal width, however a histogram may show data using unequal ranges (intervals) and therefore have columns of unequal width. The values represented by each column must be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Therefore, there are no spaces between columns and each observation can only ever belong in one column. "]]
