Generally, the data can be divided in two main categories: 2.1.1 Qualitative data Definition: is descriptive, expressed in terms of language rather than numerical values. This data describes information and cannot be measured or counted. It refers to the words or labels used to describe certain characteristics or traits. It focuses on describing an action, rather than measuring it. Moreover, qualitative data can be divided in two sub-categories: Nominal and Ordinal. Nominal Nominal data is qualitative data used to name or label variables without providing numeric values Nominal variables are labeled into categories that do not overlap The categories of nominal data are purely descriptive, that is, they do not possess any quantitative or numeric value. Nominal data can never be quantified In most cases, nominal data is alphabetical. Examples: Which state do you live in? (Italy, Germany, France, …) Preferred mode of Public Transport; Employment Status (employed, unemployed, retired) Literary Genre (comedy, tragedy, drama, epic, satire). Ordinal Ordinal data is a kind of qualitative data that groups variables into ordered categories, which have a natural order or rank based on some hierarchical scale, like from high to low. Ordinal data are non-numeric or categorical but may use numerical figures as categorizing labels. Ordinal data is always ordered, but the values are not evenly distributed. The differences between the intervals are uneven or unknown. Examples: - Rank economic status based on intervals: Poor or Low Income (€10K-€20K), Middle income (€20K-€35K), Wealthy (€35K-€100K). - Rate education level according to: Elementary, High School, College, Graduate, Post-graduate. - Company asking customers for Feedback, experience, or satisfaction on the scale: Very satisfied (5), Satisfied (4), Neutral (3), Dissatisfied (2), Very dissatisfied (1). 2.1.2 Quantitative data Definition: any information that can be quantified — that is, numbers. If it can be counted or measured, and given a numerical value, it’s quantitative in nature. Quantitative variables can tell you “how many,” “how much,” or “how often.” Moreover, qualitative data can be divided in two sub-categories: Discrete and Continuous. Discrete When the variable is described through integers values. They could be negative too, although is quite rare in nature. Examples: - Age (only number of years) - Number of devices own - Sex Continuous When the variable is described through decimal values (i.e. rational). In a continuous variable, also integers values are included (e.g. 1 is considered as 1.00) Examples: Height Daily home-work distance Liters of waters drunk "],["the-basics-visualization.html", "Sec. 3 The Basics: Visualization 3.1 Frequency Distribution", " Sec. 3 The Basics: Visualization 3.1 Frequency Distribution The frequency of a value is the number of times it occurs in a dataset. A frequency distribution is the pattern of frequencies of a variable. It’s the number of times each possible value of a variable occurs in a dataset. Example: in a given dataset that record the height of 50 children, we can group the data in 6 height categories. Now, we can build a frequency distribution table, adding the Absolute Frequency (i.e. the number of children within each category) and the Relative Frequency (i.e. the percentage over the total). We will obtain… Height (cm) of children Absolute frequency Relative frequency 120 – 130 9 18% 130 – 140 10 20% 140 – 150 13 26% 150 – 160 11 22% 160 – 170 7 14% Total 50 100% 3.1.1 Graphical representation of frequency distribution It is important to graphically represent the data and group of data. In this case, frequency distribution can be presented in graphical form as: histograms, bar plot (or bar chart) and pie plot. Histograms A histogram is a type of graph in which each column represents a numeric variable, in particular that which is continuous and/or grouped. Other features: The height of the column shows the frequency for a specific range of values. Columns are usually of equal width, however a histogram may show data using unequal ranges (intervals) and therefore have columns of unequal width. The values represented by each column must be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Therefore, there are no spaces between columns and each observation can only ever belong in one column. Other charts used to represent the frequency are: barplots and pieplot* Pieplot are often the worst choice, let’s say that could be graphically pleasant if you need to show your research results to a non-specialized public.
